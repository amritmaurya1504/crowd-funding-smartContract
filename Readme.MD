# This is a <u><b>Crowd Funding</b></u> Ethereum smart contract .


### How it works

<br>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This application has a manager who will create different request for funding like charity, flood relief fund etc. And he will set the target and deadline of the crowdfunding application, by which time we have to contribute.</p>
<li>
<p>Now Contributors Can Do contribution, and contribution should be more than minimun requirement set during deploy of smart contract.
<li>
<p>Contributers can get their contribution refunded if the target is not reached and the deadline is passed.
<li>
<p>If the target is reached and the majority contributors want the request to be funded by the manager, Then mamager can pay to the charity.
